My name is Sagiv Barhoom

Extensive parts of my field of work is in the gray area between project management, infrastructure, and programming.

During my years of work, I managed and maintained, among other things, websites and call centers for the organization in which I work.
I have been engaged in data analytics and ETL and for the past year I have been managing a DBA team that includes Oracle people and SQLserver people.

I enjoy writing code when I can, in the past I wrote in Perl - nowadays I mostly write code in Python.
In my spare time, I also serve as a research assistant in the field of computational chemistry.
