<p>
My name is Sagiv Barhoom
I work, live and breathe information systems.
Extensive parts of my field of work is in the gray area between project management, infrastructure, and programming.
</p>
<p>
During my years of work, I managed and maintained, among other things, websites and call centers for the organization in which I work.
I have been engaged in data analytics and ETL and for the past year I have been managing a DBA team that includes Oracle and SQLserver DBAs.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy writing code when I can, in the past I wrote in Perl - nowadays I mostly write code in Python.
In my spare time, I also work as a research assistant in the 
  <a href="https://continuous-symmetry.github.io/CSM-OUI/">field of computational chemistry</a> with 
  <a href="https://www.openu.ac.il/en/personalsites/InbalTuviArad.aspx">Prof. Inbal Tuvi</a>
